    <div class="container">
        <!-- to write the reserved character like <p></p><div></div><br>we use html 
            Entities -->
        <p>This is another&nbsp; &nbsp; paragraph with two spaces</p>
        <p>To write the <p> we need to add Entities so this will be written as 
            &lt;p&gt;
        </p>
        to write symbol we also use Entitiese e.g
        <p>pound symbol is written as &pound;</p>
        <p>copyright symbol is written as &copy;</p>
        <p>1/4 symbol is written as &frac14;</p>
        <p>Empty character is written as &#8203; </p>    
        <!-- this won't show on website    -->
